## This is another header
I am trying to learn this Markdown syntax. So far it feels fairly easy to grasp.

## Look at this cool image
Okay now I'm going to try to practice the image insertion synatx. Here goes.

Oh apparently pasting in the link to an image has GitHub's editor automatically format it with the right syntax. Neat.

## But can I make a table?
Here goes nothing...
| p | q | p and q |
|---|---|---------|
| T | T | T       |
| T | F | F       |
| F | T | F       |
| F | F | F       |

Let's hope that works.
